## Downloading a project from PRIDE Archive

The main purpose of this tool is to download data from the PRIDE Archive. Here, how to download all the raw files from a dataset(eg: PXD012353).

```bash
$ pridepy download-all-public-raw-files -a PXD012353 -o /Users/yourname/Downloads/foldername/ -p aspera
```
- `-a` flag is used to specify the project accession number.
- `-o` flag is used to specify the output directory. 
- `-p` flag is used to specify the protocol (**aspera, ftp, globus**)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, pridepy supports multiple protocols for downloading including ftp, aspera, globus, s3. ftp, aspera uses those protocols to download the files; the pridepy includes the aspera client. For globus and s3, the tool uses https of both services endpoints. Read the whitepaper to know more about the performance of each protocol.

Additional options: 

- `-skip` flag is used to skip the download of files that already exist in the output directory.
- `--aspera_maximum_bandwidth` flag is used to specify the maximum bandwidth for the Aspera download. The default value is 100M.
- `--checksum_check` flag is used to check the checksum of the downloaded files. The default value is False.

## Download single file by name

Users instead of downloading an entire project files may be interested in downloading a single file if they know it by name. Here is how to download a single file by name.

```bash
$ pridepy download-file-by-name -a PXD022105 -o /Users/yourname/Downloads/foldername/ -f checksum.txt -p globus
```

Please be aware that the additional parameters are the same as the previous command [Downloading a project from PRIDE Archive](#downloading-a-project-from-pride-archive).

Search projects with keywords and filters
```bash
$ pridepy search-projects-by-keywords-and-filters --filter accession==PXD012353

$ pridepy search-projects-by-keywords-and-filters --keyword PXD012353
```

Stream metadata of all projects as json and write it to a file
```bash
$ pridepy stream-projects-metadata -o all_pride_projects.json
```

Stream metadata of all files as json and write it to a file. Project accession can be specified as an optional parameter
```bash
$ pridepy stream-files-metadata -o all_pride_files.json
OR
$ pridepy stream-files-metadata -o PXD005011_files.json -a PXD005011
```

# White paper

A white paper is available at [here](paper/paper.md). We can build it as PDF using pandoc.

```bash
$docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 -v /Users/yperez/work/pridepy/paper/:/data -w /data openjournals/inara:latest paper.md -p -o pdf
```
