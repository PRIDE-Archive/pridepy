              possible thanks to continuous improvements in infrastructure such
              as a new file transfer protocol for very large datasets (Globus),
              a new data resubmission pipeline and an automatic dataset
              validation process. Additionally, we will highlight novel
              activities such as the availability of the PRIDE chatbot (based
              on the use of open-source Large Language Models), and our work to

               technologies have enabled deeper and more reproducible proteome
               characterization and a better understanding of biological
               systems when integrated with other 'omics data. Bioinformatic
               resources meeting the analysis requirements of increasingly
               complex MS-based proteomic data and associated multi-omic data
               are critically needed. These requirements included availability
               of software that would span diverse types of analyses,
               scalability for large-scale, compute-intensive applications, and
               mechanisms to ease adoption of the software. AREAS COVERED: The
               Galaxy ecosystem meets these requirements by offering a
               multitude of open-source tools for MS-based proteomics analyses
               and applications, all in an adaptable, scalable, and accessible
               computing environment. A thriving global community maintains
               these software and associated training resources to empower
               researcher-driven analyses. EXPERT OPINION: The
               community-supported Galaxy ecosystem remains a crucial
               contributor to basic biological and clinical studies using
               MS-based proteomics. In addition to the current status of
               Galaxy-based resources, we describe ongoing developments for
               meeting emerging challenges in MS-based proteomic informatics.
               We hope this review will catalyze increased use of Galaxy by
               researchers employing MS-based proteomics and inspire software
               developers to join the community and implement new tools,
               workflows, and associated training content that will add further
               value to this already rich ecosystem.",

               consortium of proteomics resources
               (http://www.proteomexchange.org) was originally set up to
               standardize data submission and dissemination of public MS
               proteomics data. It is now 10 years since the initial data
               workflow was implemented. In this manuscript, we describe the
               main developments in PX since the previous update manuscript in
               Nucleic Acids Research was published in 2020. The six members of
               the Consortium are PRIDE, PeptideAtlas (including PASSEL),
               MassIVE, jPOST, iProX and Panorama Public. We report the current
               data submission statistics, showcasing that the number of
               datasets submitted to PX resources has continued to increase
               every year. As of June 2022, more than 34 233 datasets had been
               submitted to PX resources, and from those, 20 062 (58.6\%) just

  abstract  = "The volume of proteomics and mass spectrometry data available in
               public repositories continues to grow at a rapid pace as more
               researchers embrace open science practices. Open access to the
               data behind scientific discoveries has become critical to
               validate published findings and develop new computational tools.
               Here, we present ppx, a Python package that provides easy,
               programmatic access to the data stored in ProteomeXchange
               repositories, such as PRIDE and MassIVE. The ppx package can be
               used as either a command line tool or a Python package to
               retrieve the files and metadata associated with a project when
               provided its identifier. To demonstrate how ppx enhances
               reproducible research, we used ppx within a Snakemake workflow
               to reanalyze a published data set with the open modification
               search tool ANN-SoLo and compared our reanalysis to the original
               results. We show that ppx readily integrates into workflows, and
               our reanalysis produced results consistent with the original
               analysis. We envision that ppx will be a valuable tool for
               creating reproducible analyses, providing tool developers easy
               access to data for development, testing, and benchmarking, and
               enabling the use of mass spectrometry data in data-intensive
               analyses. The ppx package is freely available and open source
