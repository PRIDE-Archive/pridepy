  abstract  = "The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database
               (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) is the world's largest data
               repository of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. PRIDE is
               one of the founding members of the global ProteomeXchange (PX)
               consortium and an ELIXIR core data resource. In this manuscript,
               we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related
               tools since the previous update manuscript was published in
               Nucleic Acids Research in 2019. The number of submitted datasets
               to PRIDE Archive (the archival component of PRIDE) has reached
               on average around 500 datasets per month during 2021. In
               addition to continuous improvements in PRIDE Archive data
               pipelines and infrastructure, the PRIDE Spectra Archive has been
               developed to provide direct access to the submitted mass spectra
               using Universal Spectrum Identifiers. As a key point, the file
               format MAGE-TAB for proteomics has been developed to enable the
               improvement of sample metadata annotation. Additionally, the
               resource PRIDE Peptidome provides access to aggregated
               peptide/protein evidences across PRIDE Archive. Furthermore, we
               will describe how PRIDE has increased its efforts to reuse and
               disseminate high-quality proteomics data into other added-value
               resources such as UniProt, Ensembl and Expression Atlas.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Continuous advances in mass spectrometry (MS)
               technologies have enabled deeper and more reproducible proteome
               characterization and a better understanding of biological
               systems when integrated with other 'omics data. Bioinformatic
               resources meeting the analysis requirements of increasingly
               complex MS-based proteomic data and associated multi-omic data
               are critically needed. These requirements included availability
               of software that would span diverse types of analyses,
               scalability for large-scale, compute-intensive applications, and
               mechanisms to ease adoption of the software. AREAS COVERED: The
               Galaxy ecosystem meets these requirements by offering a
               multitude of open-source tools for MS-based proteomics analyses
               and applications, all in an adaptable, scalable, and accessible
               computing environment. A thriving global community maintains
               these software and associated training resources to empower
               researcher-driven analyses. EXPERT OPINION: The
               community-supported Galaxy ecosystem remains a crucial
               contributor to basic biological and clinical studies using
               MS-based proteomics. In addition to the current status of
               Galaxy-based resources, we describe ongoing developments for
               meeting emerging challenges in MS-based proteomic informatics.
               We hope this review will catalyze increased use of Galaxy by
               researchers employing MS-based proteomics and inspire software
               developers to join the community and implement new tools,
               workflows, and associated training content that will add further
               value to this already rich ecosystem.",
